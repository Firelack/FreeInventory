**Free Inventory** removes the vanilla restriction that forces your inventory and other GUI screens to close when standing inside a Nether portal.

Normally, when the portal animation starts, Minecraft closes any open container. With this mod, you can organize your inventory, chat, or configure your game even while teleporting!

This is a **Client-Side** mod. You can use it on any server (Vanilla, Paper, Spigot, etc.) without needing the server to install it.

## 🤝 Compatibility & Recommendations

This mod works perfectly on its own, but it is designed to be paired with **InvMove**.

* **[InvMove](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/invmove)** allows you to walk while your inventory is open.
* **Free Inventory** keeps your inventory open inside the portal.

**Combined:** You can walk into a portal with your inventory open, check your items while the nausea effect plays, and walk out the other side !

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Keep Inventory Open:** Open and manage your inventory inside Nether portals.
* ✅ **No GUI Closing:** Prevents pause menu, inventory, and other screens from being forced closed by portal logic.
* ✅ **Seamless Teleportation:** You continue to be teleported even while menus are open (the game does not pause).
* ✅ **Client-Side Only:** No server installation required.
