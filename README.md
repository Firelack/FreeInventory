# PortalsMenus

**Minecraft Version:** 1.21.1  
**Mod Loader:** Fabric  

## ðŸ“– Description

Free Inventory removes the vanilla restriction that forces your inventory and other GUI screens to close in certain situations.
With this mod, you can keep menus (inventory, mod menus, etc.) open even when:

- Standing inside a Nether portal
- Sleeping in a bed

This is a client-side mod, so you can use it on any server without compatibility issues.

> **Note:** At the moment, this repository only contains the base Fabric template.  
> The actual feature will be added in future commits.
