**Free Inventory** removes the vanilla restriction that forces your inventory and other GUI screens to close when standing inside a Nether portal or other similar portals (with mods).

Normally, when the portal animation starts, Minecraft closes any open container. With this mod, you can organize your inventory, open GUI or access the escape menu even while teleporting!

This is a **Client-Side** mod. You can use it on any server (Vanilla, Paper, Spigot, etc.) without needing the server to install it.

>Note : This mod also prevent portals trap, because you are able to break blocs while standing in portals.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Keep Inventory Open:** Open and manage your inventory inside Nether portals and other similar portals (with compatible mods).
* ✅ **No GUI Closing:** Prevents pause menu, inventory, and other screens from being forced closed by portal logic.
* ✅ **Seamless Teleportation:** You continue to be teleported even while menus are open (the game does not pause).
* ✅ **Client-Side Only:** No server installation required.
