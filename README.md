# PortalsMenus

**Minecraft Version:** 1.21.1  
**Mod Loader:** Fabric  

## ðŸ“– Description

This mod allows you to keep menus (inventory, mod menus, etc.) open while standing inside a Nether portal.  
In vanilla Minecraft, being inside a portal automatically closes any open GUI screen. This mod removes that limitation on the client side.

> **Note:** At the moment, this repository only contains the base Fabric template.  
> The actual feature will be added in future commits.
